# First Mandatory Challenge

## Interactive Simulator

This script simulates the completion of a sticker album.
In order to do that, the player has to enter the money that he/she is willing to spend.
Then, he/she will have to decide how many packs wants to buy, until:
- A) The album is completed
- B) He/she run out of money
- C) The remaining money is not enough to complete the album

Of course, this simulation considers that the probability of obtaining new cards decreases as the album is completed.
